# MasGlobalEmployees

Once you have cloned the repository: 

1.- `cd employees`
2.- `mvn spring-boot:run` (or you can also run the project from IntelliJ)

At this point the spring application should be up and running on port 8080

3.- `cd ../employees-client`
4.- `npm install`
5.- `npm run serve`

At this point the Employees UI should be served in your localhost and should be ready to use.
